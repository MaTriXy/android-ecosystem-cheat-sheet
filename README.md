# Android Ecosystem Cheat Sheet 2020

Android ecosystem is constantly growing, so we have plenty of options to choose from.

This project maps most important parts of Android-Ecosystem (200+ tools, services, plusings & libraries). This is the most complete and most up to date picture of Android ecosystem you will find on the web. Some technologies are complementary, while others represent alternatives solutions for the same problem.

All tool are matched against [SDLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle) phases:
- Requirement analysis
- Design
- Development
- Verification
- Deployment
- Monitoring & Maintenance

Some tools belongs to multiple SDLC buckets, so they are placed where they fit the most. If given tool has more than one heavy specialisation it may be intentionally duplicated on the board.

The goal of the diagram is not to be complete in every possible way, but rather present on a big picture by focusing on up to date, useful and maintained tools.
